    <h1>We have a poultry problem.</h1>
  </div>
  <p>99% of all poultry is factory farmed<sup>[1]</sup></p>
  <p>At the same time we are eating more chicken than ever before<sup>[2]</sup></p>
  <p>Chicken produced in the U.S. per year (In metric tons)</p>
  <p>More than 8 billion chickens and turkeys are consumed in the U.S. every year<sup>[3]</sup></p>
  <p>Egg-laying hens have less space than a sheet of paper on which to spend their entire lives.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
  <p>Eight birds are crammed together in a cage the size of a file cabinet drawer.</p>
  <p>Virtually all chickens and turkeys raised for meat have been bred to grow as large as possible in the shortest amount of time.<sup>[5]</sup></p>
  <p>As a result  of modern breeding techniques,</p>
  <p>Chickens and turkeys suffer unnecessay and painful problems with skeletal development<sup>[6]</sup>, heart and lung function<sup>[7]</sup>, obesity<sup>[8]</sup>, and more.</p>

  <p>But chicken is good for us, right?</p>
  <p>“If we look at some of the biggest</p>
  <p>risk factors for early death in our society, meat is one of them.”</p>
  <p>―Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN<sup>[9]</sup>
  <p>80% of antibiotics sold in the U.S. go to farmed animals living in filthy and cramped conditions—a common practice contributing to the growing resistance of antibiotics and the emergence of drug-resistant superbugs.<sup>[10]</sup></p>
  <p>Poultry is responsible for more deaths than any other food.<sup>[11]</sup></p>
  <p>―Centers for disease control</p>
  <p>Consumer reports found that</p>
  <p>half of the chicken bought from grocery stores tested positive for at least one</p>
  <p>mulitdrug-resistant bacteria, like e. coli or campylobactor.<sup>[12]</sup></p>

  <p>What about the environment?</p>
  <p>“Factory farms are among the biggest polluters on the planet.”</p>
  <p>―Worldwatch institute, The Sierra Club, The Pew Charitable Trusts, Greenpeace</p>
  <p>At least 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from animal agriculture.<sup>[13]</sup></p>
  <p>Mark Bittman has stated that if Americans reduced meat consumption by just 20% it would have the same impact as everyone in the U.S. switching from a sedan to a hybrid.<sup>[14]</sup></p>
  <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that chicken slaughterhouses can use more than 9 gallons of water to process each bird and that's not including the water used to grow crops to feed the birds, and water the animals drink.<sup>[15]</sup></p>

  <p>What about the farmers?</p>
  <p>“[Tyson] keeps farmers in a state of indebted servitude living like modern-day sharecroppers on the ragged edge of bankruptcy.”</p>
  <p>―Christopher Leonard, <i>The Meat Racket</i></p>
  <p>Factory farms have pushed the small farmer out of buisiness</p>
  <p>Poultry slaughterhouses are some of the most dangerous industries in America. As many as 75% of workers have reported serious injuries.<sup>[18]</sup></p>

  <p>There's a better way</p>
  <p>“So over the next few years, some animals will be treated somewhat better. This is absolutely, unquestionably thanks to public pressure, which should now set its sights higher and insist that all animals grown for food production be treated not just better but well.”</p>
  <p>―Mark Bittman, <i>Author</i><sup>[19]</sup></p>
